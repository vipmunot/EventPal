     	<p class="text-justify"><strong>A.</strong> Never assume that who you are talking to is who they say they are. You are encouraged to not give your facebook, phone number or other personal contact information until you are comfortable. If you do decided to meet someone in person, we suggested you meet in a public area and let someone know where you are going to be. We recommend that you meet other members at local free Eventpal group events if available in your area. This allows you to meet multiple members at once in a public group settings. Listen to your gut instinct and report anonymously anyone who makes you feel uncomfortable. We will investigate and remove them if applicable.
